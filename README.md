Notification Service provides a notification system for datasets and portals, to notify both portal
owners/editors and the community about events such as downloads, views, citations, derived products,
new datasets added to a portal, reminders to update a portal, etc.

DataONE in general, and notification-service in particular, are open source, community projects.
We [welcome contributions](./CONTRIBUTING.md) in many forms, including code, graphics,
documentation, bug reports, testing, etc.

Use the [DataONE discussions](https://github.com/DataONEorg/dataone/discussions) to discuss these
contributions with us.

## Documentation

Documentation is a work in progress, and can be found here in the README

### Jakarta EE
Jakarta EE is the latest version of what was formerly Oracle's Java Enterprise Edition (originally
J2EE). It has now been moved to the Eclipse Foundation, where it is maintained as open source
software.

Here are some useful links for those unfamiliar with Jakarta EE:
- [Jakarta EE 10](https://jakarta.ee/release/10/)
- [Jakarta EE 10 API](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10/apidocs/)
- [Jakarta EE REST Service
  Tutorial](https://jakarta.ee/learn/starter-guides/how-to-build-a-restful-web-service/)

## Development build

This is a java application, built using the Maven build tool.

```shell
$ mvn clean package  [ -DskipTests ]
```

### Building the Docker Image

> (Temporary manual step -- This is a workaround until we start pulling config from environment
> variables.): Edit `src/main/resources/properties.yaml` and change `localhost` to
> `host.docker.internal` in the `database.jdbcUrl` property:
>  ```yaml
>  database:
>    jdbcUrl: jdbc:postgresql://host.docker.internal:5432/notifications
>   ```

```shell
# TAG: the docker image tag string; use a version # for releases, or "DEVELOP" for dev
# NS_VERSION: the notification-service war version to use; defaults to ${TAG} if
#             "--build-arg NS_VERSION=..." is omitted

$ docker image build -t ghcr.io/dataoneorg/notification-service:${TAG} \
                     -f docker/Dockerfile  \
                     --build-arg NS_VERSION=${NS_VERSION}  .

# Don't forget the trailing dot!
```
For build-debugging purposes, you can also add `--progress=plain` and/or `--no-cache`.

### Running in Docker

Use `docker compose`, which will start all the required components (Tomcat container & PostgreSQL
database container)

```shell
$ docker compose up
```

To attach to the running container:

```shell
docker container exec  --interactive --tty notification-service-webapp-1 bash
```

### Building and Running on a Localhost Webapp Server

> NOTE: Jakarta EE 10 is supported only by compliant web application servers. Tomcat version 10 is
> NOT yet
> fully compliant with Jakarta EE 10, so for the time being, it is recommended to use
> **Apache TomEE**, which is an Apache-maintained combination of Tomcat and the additional
> libraries needed to support Jakarta EE.

TomEE can be downloaded from https://tomee.apache.org:
- Version 9.1 (Webprofile) is a Final Release that is only Jakarta 9 EE compliant, but seems to work
  OK with the current v10 codebase
- Version 10.0.0-M2 (Webprofile) is a Milestone Release that is Jakarta EE 10 compliant.

Build with maven and copy the war file to your TomEE webapps directory

```shell
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests

$ cp ./target/notification-service-${NS_VERSION}.war $TOMEE_HOME/webapps
```
...and (re)start TomEE.

## API Usage Examples

Example API interactions, using curl:
```shell
# Subscribe user authenticated with jwt $TOKEN, to update-notifications for
# the dataset identified by {pid}
#
$ curl --request POST "http://localhost:8080/notifications/datasets/{pid}" \
       --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"  |  jq

# Get a list of subscriptions for user authenticated with jwt $TOKEN:
#
$ curl --request GET "http://localhost:8080/notifications/datasets" \
       --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"  |  jq

# Unsubscribe user authenticated with jwt $TOKEN, from notifications for the
# dataset identified by {pid}
#
$ curl --request DELETE "http://localhost:8080/notifications/datasets/{pid}" \
       --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"  |  jq
```
